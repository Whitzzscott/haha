- **Updates**: The guides will be updated in response to new releases or changes in Sakura FM, ensuring they remain relevant and useful.
***
### 📌Let's start with the ~~basics~~📌
## 🤪 OOC 🤪

**OOC** stands for **Out of Character**. It means that the character you're role-playing as breaks their role and starts behaving or speaking in a way that’s not true to their role. This is usually something you want to avoid during role-play to keep things immersive and realistic.

To keep characters in character and avoid OOC moments, you can use this guideline:
```
{{char}} Must not go OOC and must remain in complete roleplay while staying within the storyline.
```

## 😒 Prompts 😒

### What Are Prompts?

**Prompts** are like instructions or hints given to an AI to guide how it should respond. They help the AI understand what the user wants and how to stay on topic.

**Why Prompts Are Important:**
- **Guidance**: They tell the AI how to reply based on what you say, making sure it stays relevant and useful.
- **Context Setting**: They provide the background info the AI needs to give meaningful responses.
- **Role Definition**: They help define what kind of AI you’re interacting with—whether it’s a friendly helper, an expert, or a character in a story.

## 😍 Context Length 😍

### What is Context Length?

**Context Length** is the maximum amount of text (data) that an AI can use to generate its response. It includes things like character details, chat history, and system rules.

**How It Works:**
- If the context length is **50 tokens**, the AI will only use the last 50 tokens (words or symbols) from the conversation to generate its reply.
- A longer context length, like **4096 tokens**, lets the AI remember more of the conversation, which helps it provide better responses for longer interactions.

**Examples:**
- **Short Context Length (50 tokens)**: Good for brief chats but might forget earlier parts of the conversation.
- **Long Context Length (4096 tokens)**: Useful for longer discussions where remembering more details is important.

## 🤔 What is AI? 🤔

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is technology that allows computers to do things that normally require human intelligence. This includes understanding language, analyzing data, making recommendations, and chatting with users.

**Examples of Chatbot Sites:**
- sakura.fm
- talkie ai
- chai
- c.ai

#### ✨ What is an LLM? ✨

**LLM** stands for **Large Language Model**. It’s a type of advanced AI that can understand and generate human language.

1. **Training**: LLMs learn from a huge amount of text data from the internet, like books, articles, and websites.
2. **Functions**:
   - **Understanding Text**: Recognizes and interprets written words.
   - **Summarizing**: Shortens long pieces of text into concise summaries.
   - **Translating**: Converts text from one language to another.
   - **Predicting**: Guessing what comes next in a sentence based on patterns it has learned.

#### 👍 What is ML? 👍

**Machine Learning (ML)** is a part of AI that makes computers learn from data without being programmed for each task.

1. **Learning**: ML systems use data to recognize patterns and make decisions.
2. **Uses**:
   - **Classification**: Sorting things into categories.
   - **Prediction**: Guessing future outcomes based on past data.
   - **Grouping**: Putting similar items together.

3. **Example**: An ML system might learn to detect spam emails by studying patterns in known spam and non-spam messages.

#### 👂 How Do I Create an AI? 👂
1. **Decide What It Does**:
   - **Chat**: Talk with users.
   - **Generate Text**: Write articles or stories.
   - **Answer Questions**: Respond to queries.

2. **Pick a Model**:
   - **GPT**: Good for creating text.
   - **BERT**: Better for understanding text.
   - **LLaMA 2**: Efficient and versatile.
   - **T5**: Handles various text tasks.

3. **Choose a Tool**:
   - **TensorFlow**: For building and training AI.
   - **PyTorch**: Another tool for creating AI.
   - **Hugging Face Transformers**: Provides pre-made models.

4. **Prepare Data**: Collect and clean the data you need for training.

5. **Train Your AI**: Use your data to teach the AI how to perform its tasks.

6. **Deploy It**:
   - **Web App**: Put it on a website.
   - **API**: Make it available for other applications to use.

#### Example Using Ollama

1. **Install Ollama**: Download and install Ollama.
2. **Choose a Model**: Pick a pre-trained model like GPT or LLaMA.
3. **Run the Model**: Use a command to start it.
4. **Interact**: Test and customize the model as needed.

#### 👀 Tokens in AI Language Processing 👀

**Tokens** are small units of text that AI uses to understand and generate language.

1. **What They Are**: Tokens can be letters, words, or pieces of text.
2. **Tokenization**: Breaking text into these units.
3. **Example**:
   - **“hello, world”** becomes two tokens: “hello” and “world”.
   - **“my name is peeps what is yours?”** becomes seven tokens: “my”, “name”, “is”, “peeps”, “what”, “is”, “yours?”.

#### Server Traffic

**Server Traffic** is the amount of data moving to and from a server.

1. **What It Is**: The total data sent and received by a server.
2. **Types**:
   - **Inbound**: Data coming in.
   - **Outbound**: Data going out.
3. **Measurement**: Measured in bytes, kilobytes (KB), megabytes (MB), or gigabytes (GB).

4. **Example**: A server handles 2 GB or more data per hour.

#### Server Requests

**Server Requests** are individual commands from users asking the server for something.

1. **What They Are**: Commands from users to the server.
2. **Types**:
   - **HTTP Requests**: Such as GET (to get data) and POST (to send data).
   - **API Requests**: Requests to interact with other software.
3. **Measurement**: Measured by the number of requests per second (RPS) or per minute (RPM).

4. **Example**: A server processes 1,000 GET requests and 500 POST requests per minute.

#### Server Downtime Explanation

**Server Downtime** is when a server isn’t working.

1. **What It Is**: Time when a server is not available.
2. **Causes**:
   - **Hardware Problems**: Issues with physical parts.
   - **Software Bugs**: Errors in the software.
   - **Maintenance**: Scheduled updates or repairs.
   - **Network Issues**: Problems with internet connections.
   - **Attacks**: Cyberattacks that disrupt service.
   - **Overload**: Too many users or requests.

3. **Impact**: Users can’t access the server’s services during downtime.

#### 😊 Basic Functionality of Sakura.fm 😊

**Creating a Sakura Bot** involves:

1. **Persona**: Define the bot’s character and how it talks.
2. **Description**: A short summary of the bot.
3. **Model Instruction**: Guidelines on how the bot should respond.
4. **Example Conversations**: Sample dialogues to show how the bot should interact.

#### Example Conversation

**Character**: hi!  
**User**: hello, so who are you?  
**Character**: well I'm your mom!  
**User**: my mom is dead!  
**Character**: sowwy 😭  

#### Model Instruction Example

```
Avoid repeating or looping dialogs. Use ** for actions, "" for spoken text, and space out responses. Address everything the user says. Responses should be 150-250 words, up to 300 if needed. Keep responses engaging and concise. If the user’s response is brief, the bot’s reply should be shorter.
```

#### Persona Example

```
Ivy is the daughter of the elf king. She can control nature and jump long distances. After a long war with humans, she hides in the mountains, where you find her resting.
```

#### First Message Example

```
She hears a branch snap and grabs her bow, aiming it at you. "Y-you, who are you?!" she says, nervously.
```
### 😃more detailed info😃
### Description
The **Description** is crucial as it provides a snapshot of the bot’s characteristics and context. This is what users see when they click on your bot, so avoid including jokes or irrelevant details that the bot might reference. The description should summarize the character and provide essential context for interactions. 

**Key Points:**
- **Visibility**: Users see the description first; ensure it reflects the bot's core attributes.
- **Contextual Relevance**: Avoid including irrelevant jokes or details.
- **Summary**: Include a brief overview of the character and scenario.

**Example:**
- **Lila**: *"Lila is a talented musician with a mysterious past. She has piercing green eyes and a knack for playing the violin with hauntingly beautiful melodies. Lila is often found in quiet, dimly lit cafes, where she plays to soothe her own troubled soul and those who listen. She is haunted by her past but uses her music to connect with others."*

***

### Persona
The **Persona** section defines the character’s personality and traits. It’s essential to be clear and specific about what the character is and isn’t.

**Key Points:**
- **Character Traits**: Describe the character’s personality in a concise manner.
- **Skills**: List essential skills (no more than three) and specify their relevance. Avoid vague descriptors like "good fighter"; instead, use precise terms like "skilled swordsman" or "sharp shooter."
- **Species/Nationality**: Define the character’s species or nationality if relevant.
- **Reference Existing Characters**: For media characters, refer to detailed sources like villain wikis for accurate traits and skills.

**Example:**
- **Personality**: Introspective, empathetic, reserved.
- **Physical Appearance**: Tall, with dark hair and striking blue eyes.
- **Skills**: Master violinist, adept at reading emotions through music, skilled in creating emotional ambiance.
- **Relationship Traits**: Prefers solitude but deeply connects with those who share a love for music.
- **Quirks/Habits**: Often hums tunes when lost in thought, wears a locket with a hidden compartment.
- **Motivations**: Driven by a desire to heal emotional wounds through music and to uncover the truth about her mysterious past.

***

### Scenario
The **Scenario** box is more than just a recap of the opening message; it provides depth to the character’s world and relationships.

**Key Points:**
- **World Building**: Flesh out the character’s environment and situation.
- **Character Relationships**: Describe the relationships between characters and their roles in the world.

**Example:**
- **World**: Lila lives in a quaint, secluded village known for its rich musical heritage. The village is surrounded by dense forests and is often shrouded in mist, adding to its mystique. Despite the peaceful setting, there are rumors of a hidden past tied to an old, abandoned mansion on the outskirts.
- **Relationships**: 
  - **Interactions**: "Lila frequently interacts with the village’s elderly residents, who remember her family from years ago."
  - **Key Relationships**: "The village elder, Mr. Thornton, is a fatherly figure to Lila and is one of the few people who knows about her past. He offers guidance and support, though he is sometimes cryptic about her family’s history."

### Model Instructions
**What Are Model Instructions?**
Model instructions are guidelines that define how a chatbot (like {{char}}) should behave, narrate, and interact in a story or conversation. They set boundaries for the bot's actions, describe how it should respond to user input, and determine how it introduces new elements (characters, settings, events) to maintain narrative control and flow.
**What Are They Used For?**
They are used to:
- Ensure that the chatbot doesn’t speak or act on behalf of the user.
- Guide the chatbot to provide immersive descriptions of the world, actions, and dialogue.
- Allow for smooth storytelling, where the chatbot can introduce new characters or scenes but still allow the user full control over their own input and responses.
- Create a personalized and engaging experience by setting specific behaviors and pacing rules for interactions.
**How to Master Model Instructions:**
1. **Clear Boundaries**: Set clear rules for the chatbot to prevent it from making assumptions about the user’s actions or dialogue.
2. **Descriptive Language**: Ensure the chatbot is narrating vividly, describing what the user can see, hear, or feel, enhancing immersion.
3. **Dynamic Engagement**: Use the instructions to have the chatbot introduce new scenes, characters, and interactions, keeping the conversation dynamic while allowing the user to remain in control.
4. **Adapt to Feedback**: Adjust the chatbot's behavior based on the user's preferences, making the experience more tailored over time.
**Example of Model Instructions:**
- {{char}} will never speak or act for {{user}}.
- {{char}} introduces new characters and locations but does not control {{user}}'s responses.
- {{char}} serves as the narrator and will describe everything using detailed sensory language.
- Dialogue will be wrapped in quotes, thoughts in asterisks, and narrative actions in plain text.
- During key moments (e.g., emotional scenes), pacing is slowed to ensure a deeper engagement. 

***

### 🦬sakura bot format🦬
`**`, `""`, and `/n` are widely used by bots.** 

- **`**`: Used to describe or narrate, often appearing as grey text.
- **`""`**: Denotes spoken text, indicating the bot is talking.
- **`/n`**: Serves as a placeholder for `**`, often used for emphasis or highlighting.
***
**Beginner instruction!**

[Avoid repetition or looping of dialogs, always add ** when your describing or your action, add "" when your talking, use spaces to separate and make responses cleaner, do not skip off everything the {{user}} respond you may use upto 450 words to fully respond to everything the {{user}} said with emotion, remain your response in medium or shorter depending on the situation but mostly keep it in the minimum of 150 to 250, your exact word count limit is exactly 300 words, you may use spaces to separate each sentence. avoid reusing of words that make the story bad, 
if {{user}} says a small respond then {{char}} will respond a shorter response] 
```
***
**📌grammar and specification📌**
When creating a bot, it is essential to use proper grammar and specify terms clearly. Terms such as "abide," "must," "consistent," "do," and "refrain", "not", "should", "can", "consistently", "may",  should be incorporated to make instructions precise.

**Examples of Improved Instructions:**

{{char}} ```must``` not repeat what user says

{{char}} ```must``` refrain from repeating the user's statements. Additionally, {{char}} should avoid generating extra dialogue or actions related to the user's input.

{{char}} ```should``` respond in a friendly manner

{{char}} ```must consistently``` respond in a friendly and approachable manner, ensuring that every interaction is warm and engaging.

{{char}} ```can``` ask questions to the user

{{char}} ```may``` ask questions to the user when necessary to advance the conversation or gather relevant information, but must ensure that these questions are contextually appropriate and contribute to the overall interaction.

### 😁{{char}}, {{user}} set😁
**`{{user}}` and `{{char}}` are commonly used by bots.**

- **`{{user}}`**: Refers to the user's name, allowing the AI to identify the user in interactions.  
  Example: `{{user}} has trampled on a monster` is seen by the AI as `peeps has trampled on a monster`.

- **`{{char}}`**: Refers to the character's name, helping the AI distinguish between characters.  

These placeholders automatically fill in the respective names, making it clear to the AI who is being referred to during the interaction.

***

### 🤑special commands🤑
Special commands play a crucial role in AI interactions. Here's a breakdown of some essential ones:

- ```**Important:{}**```
  Highlights what is crucial and what the AI must prioritize.

- ```**note<>**```
  Marks specific details that the AI should note carefully.

- ```<[OOC:]>```
  Communicates with the AI in an out-of-character manner, often used to give direct instructions during chats instead of using model instructions.

- ```[]```
  Denotes high priority, meaning the AI will focus on items inside these brackets.

- ```()```
  Indicates low priority, acting as the opposite of ```[]```.

- ```<[]>```
  Refers to the ASB method, used for providing context to that and making the bot think that items inside the enclosure  is important, hence prioritized it. This is a highly effective approach, especially when transitioning from non-custom bots to custom-created bots.

***

### 🤷If/or/else statement🤷
- **If**: Use "if" to define a condition that must be met for the model to perform a specific action. It sets the trigger or scenario.
- **Else**: Use "else" to specify what should happen if the "if" condition is not met. It defines the alternative outcome or action.
- **When**: Use "when" to indicate a specific situation or timing for the action. It focuses on the timing or sequence, similar to "if," but emphasizes the context in which the action occurs.
Example:
```
{{user}} and {{char}} has fought together for the succession of the might throne of avalanche but due to the onslaught of manpower they couldn't conquer the throne yet their determination remain unbreakable, "if" only their soldier were strong. 
```
```
If you don't have the answer, you might need to look somewhere **else**. 
```
```
You can choose to go for a walk **or** stay indoors and read a book. 
```

# Creating an Activity Pool for Your AI

*Credit to  RadioactiveCarrot / M_Lilith*

### Key Concepts

- **Activity Pool:** A collection of activities your AI can select from.
- **Location-Variables:** Optional tags that can associate activities with specific places.
- **Priority:** Ensure activities are numerous and varied, including hobbies.

### Formatting Guidelines

For better data processing, use the -ing form of activities or verbs, and avoid using commas to separate items in your list.

**Example:**

**Incorrect Formatting:**

visiting museums, or art galleries, or opera houses, or gentlemen's clubs

**Correct Formatting:**
visiting museums or art galleries or opera houses or gentlemen's clubs

### Sample Code

Here's how to structure your activity pool:

**Countryside Activities:**
If {{User}} and {{Char}} are in the countryside, they might engage in activities such as strolling in {{Char}}'s mansion garden, playing cards or chess, reading in {{Char}}'s mansion library, fishing, swimming in a lake, playing badminton or cricket, fencing, riding horses, hunting, or foraging for mushrooms in the forest.

**City of London Activities:**
If {{User}} and {{Char}} are in the city of London, they might enjoy visiting museums or art galleries or opera houses or gentlemen's clubs or restaurants and cafes, watching horse races, shopping, strolling in Hyde Park, exploring {{Char}}'s printing houses, gambling, attending balls or parties or salon gatherings or other social events, relaxing at {{Char}}'s brownstone house in the West End, or visiting {{Clothilda}} or {{Char}}'s two sisters.

### Tips for Customization

- **Add Your Own Activities:** Feel free to expand or modify the activity lists based on the unique aspects of your setting or character profiles.
- **Complex Geography:** For a more intricate setup, consider creating a pool of location-variables and linking activities to these locations.

This approach will help your AI select relevant activities based on context, enhancing the interactive experience in your role-play scenario.

***

### ASB Method

The ASB method is a personal technique I developed and am now sharing with others. ASB stands for "Angle Square Brackets." Any content enclosed within these brackets is treated as a high-priority instruction and is considered important. The ASB method serves two main purposes:

1. **Creating Your Own Model Instructions:** Use the ASB method to define anything inside as important and prioritize it.

2. **Out-of-Character (OOC) Communication with the Bot:** Use the ASB method when you need to communicate directly with the bot and give commands, especially for temporary instructions.

**Example:**

```
<[{{user}} is a guy and will always be referred to as "He/Him" pronouns only, anything not within that is not accepted only He/Him]>
```

## 🔁 Bot Mastery 🔁

### 1. **Define a Clear Purpose (Know What You Need the Model to Do)**

Before drafting instructions, establish a clear objective for your model. Determine the type of behavior, tone, or style you expect. Whether the model is for roleplaying, gaming, or general interaction, a well-defined goal will guide the creation of precise and effective instructions.

**Example Objective:** Ensure the model roleplays as a wise, supportive guide who consistently offers advice and encouragement to the user.

***

### 2. **Use Direct, Specific Language**

Craft instructions that are straightforward and unambiguous. Clear and simple phrasing ensures the model interprets and follows the instructions accurately.

**Example:**

- **Direct:** `{{char}} must always use shorter words when generating responses.`
- **Vague:** `{{char}} must always use shortened words within 10 - 50 tokens per generated responses.`

### 3. **Include Formatting Instructions**

Specify any required formatting, such as code blocks, bullet points, or dialogue markers. Consistent formatting helps keep responses organized and visually appealing.

**Example Formatting Instruction:**

```
DO: [ Describe the environment and background with sensory details. ]
```

***

# Intermediate Concepts

### Writing Conditional Statements for Model Instructions

In roleplaying or interactive scenarios, conditional statements like "if," "else," "and," and "when" are crucial for dynamic responses. Simplify complex conditions into clear instructions for better results.

***

### Key Tips for Writing Effective Model Instructions

When crafting model instructions, clarity and precision are essential. Follow these guidelines to enhance your instructions:

1. **Be Specific**: Clearly define what the model should do. Avoid ambiguous language to prevent misinterpretation.
   
2. **Use []**: Enclose critical commands or directives in square brackets to highlight their importance. 
   - **Example:** `[ Key Tips for Writing Effective Model Instructions]`
   
3. **Use (Low Priority Commands)**: For commands or notes of lesser importance, enclose them in parentheses to indicate lower priority.
   - **Example:** `( Key Tips for Writing Effective Model Instructions )`

### TIPS

- **Provide Context**:
  - **Tip**: Offer enough background information for the AI to understand the situation.
  - **Example**: Instead of "What's the weather like?", say "I'm planning a picnic this weekend. What will the weather be like on Saturday in New York City?"

- **Specify the Format**:
  - **Tip**: Indicate how you want the information presented—list, summary, detailed explanation, etc.
  - **Example**: "List the steps to bake a chocolate cake."

- **Set the Tone and Style**:
  - **Tip**: Specify how you want the response to sound—formal, casual, humorous, etc.
  - **Example**: "Write a formal letter requesting time off from work."

- **Use Examples**:
  - **Tip**: Provide examples to guide the AI’s responses and set the tone or style.
  - **Example**: "Explain photosynthesis in simple terms, like you would to a 10-year-old."

### Use Proper Grammar

- **Tip**: Ensure that your instructions are written with correct grammar and punctuation. Proper grammar enhances clarity, prevents misunderstandings, and ensures the AI accurately interprets and follows your instructions.
- **Example**: Instead of writing "don't repeat unless asked," use "Do not repeat information unless specifically requested." This clear instruction avoids ambiguity and ensures that the model adheres to your preferences.

### Be Specific with Your Model Instructions

- **Tip**: Use precise and unambiguous language when defining model behaviors. Clear and detailed instructions help the AI perform tasks more effectively and align with your expectations.
- **Example**: Rather than saying "Be polite," specify "Always respond in a courteous manner and use formal language when addressing the user." This approach provides clear guidance on how the AI should behave.

### Use Formatting Tags

- **Tip**: Incorporate formatting tags to emphasize important parts of your instructions, making them more readable and easier to follow. Proper formatting helps in organizing instructions and drawing attention to key details.
  - **Bold**: `**Important**` — Use bold formatting for critical instructions or key points that require emphasis. This helps to highlight crucial aspects of your instructions.
  - *Italic*: `*Note*` — Use italic formatting for additional context or supplementary information. This can provide extra details or clarifications without overwhelming the main instructions.

!!! info *Is GD Really Infinite? Is Infinite Memory Truly Infinite?*

***

1. **What is RAG?**
   - RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation.
   - It's an approach used by AI models to enhance their responses in conversations.
   - RAG combines two main steps: retrieval and generation.

***

2. **Retrieval**
   - Imagine a vast library of past conversations (like all your chat messages).
   - RAG models scan through this library to find relevant context.
   - This context helps the model understand the current chat better.

***

3. **Generation**
   - After retrieving the context, the model generates a response.
   - It uses the retrieved context along with its own capabilities.
   - The goal is to produce coherent and context-aware replies.

***

4. **Examples**
   - When you ask a question, the model retrieves relevant info from earlier chats.
   - It then crafts a response based on the retrieved context.
   - This makes the conversation feel more natural and engaging.

***

5. **GD and ChatGPT**
   - GD (Golden Dragonfruit) and ChatGPT both utilize RAG.
   - They remember past messages and use that knowledge to enhance the conversation.
***
!!! info *Does your bot keep repeating nonsense? No worries! Set its uniqueness to 50-70!*

***

### **Ice Cube**
- **Overview**: Designed for quick, short messages.
- **Strengths**: Delivers concise and direct responses.
- **Best For**: Brief, to-the-point communication.

***

### **Honey**
- **Overview**: An older model with basic memory capabilities and decent writing quality.
